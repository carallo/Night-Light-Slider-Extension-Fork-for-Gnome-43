# Night-Light-Slider-Extension-Fork-for-Gnome-43

This is a fork of the [Gnome Shell Night Light Slider Extension by Kiyui](https://codeberg.org/kiyui/gnome-shell-night-light-slider-extension/), to try to make it work on Gnome 43

## Original readme:

Manage GNOME's built-in night light temperature intensity from the aggregate menu!

![extension preview](./images/extension.gif)![extension in submenu](./images/show_in_submenu.gif)![extension with brightness sync](./images/brightness_sync.gif)

- Click or scroll the slider to change the Night Light temperature
- Scroll on the indicator to change the Night Light temperature
- The preference panel even supports a quick toggle to enable Night Light if it's disabled!

### Preferences

![extension preferences](./images/preferences.gif)

The extension can be customized with the following preferences:

- Change the slider position in the aggregate menu, either at the top-level or in the Night Light submenu
- Always have the slider shown, even when the Night Light is disabled
- Toggle the indicator visibility
- Swap the axis of the slider
- Sync Night Light slider percentage with brightness (albeit not vice-versa, works well on laptops with well tuned temperature ranges)
- Enable permanent Night Light via having a timer constantly shift and update the Night Light schedule
- Adjust minimum and maximum temperature values

### Installation

Available from GNOME extensions website [here](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1276/night-light-slider/), make sure to enable Night Light under Settings/Display

### Tips

If you enjoy this extension, consider buying Kiyui a coffee ðŸ˜„
